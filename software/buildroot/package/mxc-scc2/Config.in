          The SCCv2 is a built-in hardware module that implements secure RAM and a
          dedicated AES cryptographic engine for encryption/decryption operations.

          This kernel driver is a port of the original Freescale one for Linux
          3.x, with assorted bugfixes and the addition of the new character device
          driver.
